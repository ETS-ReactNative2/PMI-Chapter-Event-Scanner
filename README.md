# PMI Chapter Event Scanner

I led the development of the PMI Chapter Event Scanner mobile app available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/pmi-chapter-event-scanner/id1481983760) and [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mg2media.eventscanner) for Project Management Institute (PMI), a global client of MG2 Media. The app enables PMI event hosts to seamlessly check-in guests with a QR code scanner and spans 40 PMI locations across North America, from Montreal to Hawaii.

I used React Native, an open-source mobile application framework, to develop the front-end for both iOS and Android. I also worked with Redux to properly manage application state, and communicated with back-end teams to facilitate communications with the server via a REST API.
