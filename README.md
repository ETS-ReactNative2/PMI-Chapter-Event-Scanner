# PMI-Chapter-Event-Scanner

I developed the PMI Chapter Event Scanner app from start to finish for Project Management Institute (PMI), a global client of MG2 Media. The app enables PMI event hosts to seamlessly check-in guests with a QR code scanner and is used every day spanning 40 locations across North America from Montreal to Hawaii.

I used React Native, a mobile app framework, to efficiently develop the entire front-end of the app over the course of two months, including working with back-end teams to enable communications with the server via a RESTful API.
